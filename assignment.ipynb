How does the slope coefficient for `Review Scores Rating`, the $R^2$, and the RMSE change? Do they increase significantly compares to part 5?

For your best model with expanded features, what is the $R^2$ and `RMSE`? How does it compare to your best model from part 4?\n",

We would like to understand how that outcome is predicted by characteristics of the defendant, particularly race. Let's be very careful/clear: We aren't saying anyone *should* be held without bond or asserting that people with different demographic variables *should* be more likely to be held, but instead trying to predict whether people with different characteristics *are empirically more likely* to be held without bond, given the available information. This is the first step we would take in investigating whether a system is fair, or how large the disparities are: Does it treat people with similar observable characteristics similarly, or not? We are going to look at a common question: Are Black defendants treated differently from white or Asian ones? (There are Native American defendants, but there are 11 in total, which is such a small number of observations that is difficult to clearly say anything about how this group is treated relative to the others.)\n",
